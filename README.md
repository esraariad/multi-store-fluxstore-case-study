# multi-store-fluxstore-case-study
Case study for building multiple customized e-commerce apps using Flutter Flavors and FluxStore.

Project Overview:
This project involves developing a series of e-commerce mobile applications for restaurants using FluxStore. The app leverages Flutter Flavors to generate over 40 different versions of the same app, each tailored for a specific restaurant. The core functionality includes displaying meals, filtering items, adding products to the cart, and implementing payments using Stripe. Additionally, the app incorporates a loyalty points system and subscription management to enhance user engagement.

My Role:
Adding Flutter Flavors:

Integrated Flutter Flavors to produce multiple versions of the same codebase for different clients (restaurants), allowing each version to be fully customized.

Used Flavors to handle distinct configurations such as branding, colors, logos, and payment settings for each client.

UI/UX Enhancements:

Improved the overall UI/UX design to ensure a smooth, responsive, and visually appealing user experience, with a focus on mobile-first design and device compatibility.

Customized design elements to match the branding of different restaurants.

Stripe Payment Integration:

Integrated Stripe for seamless in-app payments, enabling users to purchase items securely and efficiently.

Loyalty Points and Subscription Features:

Implemented a loyalty points system to encourage user retention and interaction, allowing users to accumulate points and redeem them for rewards.

Developed a subscription system to offer special deals, promotions, and exclusive content to subscribers.

Problem Solving and Ongoing Maintenance:

Continuously addressed various technical challenges and bug fixes that emerged post-launch.

Optimized the app's performance to ensure fast load times and smooth navigation across all devices.

Tech Stack:
Flutter & Dart: Used to build the applications.

FluxStore: The base framework for the e-commerce app.

Stripe: For handling online payments.

Firebase: For real-time data storage and user authentication.

Flutter Flavors: For managing multiple app versions.

Clean Code Practices: To maintain scalability and performance.

Challenges Faced:
Managing Multiple App Versions: The initial challenge was handling over 40 different versions of the app. Using Flutter Flavors, I was able to manage the different configurations and customize the apps for each client.

Optimizing Performance: With the increasing number of apps and versions, continuous optimization was necessary to ensure fast performance on all devices.

App Store Compliance: I had to navigate and resolve issues related to App Store and Google Play Store policies, ensuring that each app met their specific requirements.

Screenshots:
You can add relevant screenshots of the apps here. Make sure to include images that show the app's UI, features, or any specific customizations made.

Outcome:
Launched 40+ apps successfully on both Google Play Store and Apple App Store, all of which are tailored to the unique needs of each restaurant.

Increased user engagement by adding Stripe payments and a loyalty points system.

Enhanced user retention through the subscription features, providing exclusive offers to subscribers.

Improved app performance and resolved bugs, ensuring smooth user experiences on all devices.
